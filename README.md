# 🛡️ Online Payments Fraud Detection ML Project 🚨

Welcome to my **Online Payments Fraud Detection ML Project**! This repository contains code to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using Machine Learning techniques.

## 📅 About the Project
Today, I built a new project that focuses on **detecting fraudulent transactions** in online payment systems using **Python** and its powerful libraries.

The project covers several stages:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🧑‍💻
- **Feature Engineering** 🔧
- **Building a Machine Learning Model** 🤖
- **Predicting Fraud or Not (Scam or Not)** 🔍

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Loaded and explored the dataset 📊
   - Visualized trends and patterns using graphs 📉
   - Analyzed distributions and correlations 🔍

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values 🧹
   - Created new features to improve model accuracy 🛠️
   - Normalized and scaled the features for better results ⚙️

3. **Model Building**:
   - Implemented different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) ⚡
   - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV 🔧
   - Evaluated model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score 📊

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Achieved a **high prediction accuracy** for fraud detection ✅
   - Predicted whether a transaction is fraudulent or not using the trained model 🔮

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: 
  - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn 📚
  - scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm 🤖
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook 💻
- **Modeling Techniques**: Classification Algorithms ⚡

## 📌 Key Features

- **Fraud Detection**: Identify fraudulent transactions in an online payment system 🕵️‍♂️
- **Scalability**: Model can be applied to large-scale transaction datasets 📦
- **Customizable**: You can easily adapt the model for your own dataset 🛠️

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishekkumar62000/Online-Payments-Fraud-Detection-ML-Project.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the project:
   - Open the **notebooks** and follow the steps to reproduce the results 🚶‍♂️
